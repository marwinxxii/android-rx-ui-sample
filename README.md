# android-rx-ui-sample
Android reactive UI sample made for [Yandex Mobile Camp 2015] (https://events.yandex.ru/lib/talks/3279/).

This sample contains one screen with different views which represent
filter used to request available realty offers from web server.

Here you can find comparison between traditional way of building UI using only Android API
and reactive way, using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding).

Note, that this code is only a sample and some of it's parts may not be ready for production usage
(mostly in traditional sample. This is because I didn't want to cover all cases in this sample).
